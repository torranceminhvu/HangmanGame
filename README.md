# HangmanGame

Personal Project that recreats the Hangman game using Netbean. This program is coded in java and the executable is a jar. 

Starting the program, the program will prompt the user to input a word that the program will use to have another user the same user guess against. Future versions will allow the user to import a file contained with a list of words that the program will randomly pick to use as the mystery word. The input word must be between 4-15 characters long. After inputting the word, the main program will start and allow the user to guess. The user can either guess the word or guess one character at a time. The user can choose to restart the game with the same mystery word or start a new game with a different mystery word.
